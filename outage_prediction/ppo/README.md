### OPM - Outage Prediction Model

#### The ultimate goal of this study is to reliably predict when sustained power outages will occur. A secondary and related goal is to identify transformers (and, eventually, other types of equipment) at risk of failing and therefore causing an outage. This predictive ability will allow AEP to:

####     Notify affected customers prior to an outage event, which will increase customer satisfaction

####     Allocate resources prior to outage events, which will reduce the length of outages and ultimately save money

####     Attempt to remedy faulty equipment prior to outage event, thus eliminating potential outages.
