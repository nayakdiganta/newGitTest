# Model to Ensure our Cutomer Meters to Transformer Ties are as accurate as they can be.

Provide bulk autonomous fix to all existing customer tie issues in our GIS mappings.  Also automate ongoing remediation going forward.  One component of doing this, is using field personnel to validate model.  This will benefit all OPCOs, AEP Ohio has volunteered field personnel for validation.  Additionally, the stage will be set for potential future automation of updating/creating redlines directly in Electric Office.


# Background
An audit of the Customer Mobile Outage Alerts process was concluded in May 2019.  The audit identified a significant finding for â€œPremises with missing or inconsistent Transformer Locations between MACSS, Trouble Entry Reporting System (TERS), Electric Office (EO) and GE PowerOn Restore (POR).  While the primary audit findings have been remediated, it was identified that a more robust solution is needed to further remediate the findings.
